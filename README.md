# data-over-audio
I'm playing with the amount of data that can be sent over sound, and trying to better understand waves.
## Disclaimer
I'm working on this project to try and understand a contradiction in my understanding of physics and information theory. I'm hoping to learn something about audio engineering, linear algebra, physics, or information theory through this project. I'm aware the project is a little absurd. Please feel free to mention errors to me.
